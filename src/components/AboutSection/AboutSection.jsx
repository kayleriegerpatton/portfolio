					<p>
						I&apos;m a software developer and former arts accessibility
						specialist.
					</p>
					<p>
						I took the leap into tech by leveraging my creativity,
						problem-solving, and adaptability. I&apos;ve since developed
						cloud-based services in AWS using JavaScript plus frameworks and
						tools such as React, Node.js, GraphQL, and Jest. I&apos;m also
						skilled in advocating for inclusive web design practices to enhance
						user experiences.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a former artist and disability advocate, I bring unique
						perspectives and dedication to creating exceptional customer
						experiences. I&apos;m eager to contribute to values-driven teams to
						further expand my skills and drive meaningful impact through
						cross-functional collaboration.
					</p>

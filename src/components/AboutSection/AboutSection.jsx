					<p>
						I&apos;m a software developer and former arts accessibility
						specialist.
					</p>
					<p>
						I retrained into tech through an intensive boot-camp where I quickly
						grasped new technologies and concepts such as JavaScript, React,
						Node.js, GraphQL, database structures, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a former artist and disability advocate, I bring unique
						perspectives and dedication to creating exceptional user
						experiences. I&apos;m eager to contribute my skills to meaningful
						projects, driven by a desire to make a positive impact everywhere I
						go.
					</p>
					<p>
						I bring an eye for design and a heart for people to everything I do.

Her passion for accessibility is really clearly grounded in real world experience from previous roles and is a great example of bringing other sector experience into tech.",

		text: 'Looking through the new [CLI] docs and honestly they look amazing, and so consistent and much easier to understand than probably 99% of the documentation I normally read...
